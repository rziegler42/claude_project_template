# Roadmaps

Roadmaps are tracked, committed, non-authoritative documents for multi-plan
direction. They preserve ordering, dependencies, plan boundaries, and rationale.
They do not authorize implementation or change `docs/plans/next.md`.

## Lifecycle

- `docs/plans/next.md` is the sole active implementation plan.
- Promote one selected roadmap candidate into a complete, reviewed, explicitly
  approved active plan only after the current plan is archived or superseded.
- Record durable architectural choices in `docs/decisions/`; roadmaps explain
  sequence and dependencies but do not replace ADRs.
- Keep implementation-ready file lists, detailed acceptance criteria, and
  executable verification commands in the promoted plan.

## Naming and index

- Use stable, lowercase, kebab-case scope names such as
  `short-term-platform.md` or `frontend-scaling.md`.
- Do not use four-digit plan numbers in roadmap filenames.
- Keep one active roadmap per scope and update it in place.
- Move completed or superseded roadmaps to `docs/roadmaps/archive/` with a
  `YYYY-MM-` prefix.

## Index (current)
