# Architecture decisions

Record durable design choices here as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
ADRs explain why a decision was made; current architecture documents describe
the resulting system.

## Status and lifecycle

- **Proposed** — under review; not yet a project decision.
- **Accepted** — explicitly approved design decision. Implementation may
  follow in a separate plan.
- **Rejected** — considered but explicitly not adopted.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer ADR, which links back to this record.

Do not rewrite an accepted ADR to change a decision. Create a new ADR that
supersedes it. Record implementation evidence in the ADR's verification section
and in the associated implementation plan.

## Naming and format

- Use the next unused four-digit number: `0001-short-title.md`.
- Do not reuse, renumber, or fill gaps in ADR numbers.
- Keep each ADR concise: context, decision, alternatives, consequences,
  verification, and related documents.
